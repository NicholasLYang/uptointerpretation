People often talk about jobs as a binary of stable/unstable. I don't
think that's a particularly helpful categorization. Instead, maybe we
should talk about a job's risk factors, i.e. what risks are you
exposing yourself to by taking this job?

Like take a defense contractor job. That's considered a "stable"
job. And for many risk factors that would be true. It's fairly
recession proof. There isn't a huge AI replacement risk since
governments tend to move slowly. And it's unlikely to get outsourced.

On the flip side, you're exposed to the whims of the current
administration. In most cases that's pretty irrelevant, but currently?
That's a massive downside.

Or how about a job at an early stage startup, say a series A or even
seed. That's a supposedly "risky" job. And there are indeed risks. The
risks are that the startup can't get enough revenue, or the founders
start fighting, or you have a really unpleasant experience with a
coworker but there's only 6 people so you can't avoid them. But there
are also non-risks. For example, startups aren't as exposed to the
general market environment. If you were working at GitHub during the
global financial crisis in 2008, it probably wouldn't have affected
you that much. Similarly, a startup isn't expected to be profitable, so
if it hits a bad quarter, it won't have to do reactionary layoffs. If
the burn rate is low enough, many startups can keep chugging along for
multiple years.

A big tech job will have other risks. Maybe the company will have a
bad quarter and institute massive layoffs. Maybe the CEO will decide
to go full founder-mode and institute 996. Maybe you'll get
re-organized ad nauseum.

Risk factors depend on the state of the world. A startup job may be
more risky in normal times because its risk factors are constant: no
matter what, startups are not stable. But when the economy is bad and
the government is dysfunctional, the startup job starts to look better.

Of course risk factors are probabilities and unfortunately you can
only have a sample size of one at a time[^1]. But it's still worth considering
them.
