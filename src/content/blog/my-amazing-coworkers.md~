Sometimes I think about how luck I've been in my coworkers. People
talk online about incompetent and lazy coworkers, about
terrible code and poor documentation. In almost every place that I've
worked, that has not been the case. I've generally worked with
extremely competent people doing very good work. To the point where
sometimes I wonder if I just inhabit a different world from the
people online. Or perhaps I'm the incompetent person people keep
complaining about.
