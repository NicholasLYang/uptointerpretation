If you haven't already, check out [part
1](https://uptointerpretation.com/posts/chili-oil-notes/). These are
more musings that I've written over time, so there's some additions
that contradict previous stuff as I've done more experiments over
time.

# Resources

Here's a list of resources for chili oil. As a whole, it's pretty
remarkable how much more sophisticated the Chinese videos are for
chili oil. They tend to have a lot more thought around infusion and
chili processing. Most of the Western videos are quite terrible and
similar. Only a few really bother to add spices, put good quality
peppers, and do some careful infusion.

- [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfFNXX_BMHo): An interesting
  take by a Chinese chef. Uses the multiple infusion technique where a
  hot first infusion "is for spice", and then subsequent infusions are
  for flavor. Uses a combination of chili flakes, chili powder, and
  hand ground chilies. The video does claim that adding spices or
  aromatics lessens the chili flavor, which I'm not sure about.

- [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0aGgCuvH4): Probably one of
  the best Chinese videos on chili oil by Chef Wang Gang. Similar
  technique to above with an interesting wrinkle of adding baijiu,
  supposedly to avoid burning the chilies. I wonder if it adds to
  flavor extraction too. Also lots of interesting spices and herbs
  added.

- [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpgawC2FKp4): Another Wang Gang
  video. I don't like douchi in chili oil, but this one is interesting
  for the step where the spices are soaked in baijiu to extract
  flavor.

- [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GezQyVRQRzU): Still my go-to
  recipe for a chili crisp. Sohla does a great job of adding a balance
  of flavors with additions like mushroom powder, MSG, sugar, and a
  whole bunch of spices. The single hot flash does the trick and the
  sugar offsets any potential bitterness. Fantastic recipe.

- [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJtOATAZl4): This is a really
  interesting idea of using clarified butter to make an oil with a
  fairly standard slow infusion process, then blending it with toasted
  milk powder to make essentially brown butter. Kathy seems to blend
  all of the aromatics too (I think?) which is interesting. She then
  whips it up into a compound butter, kinda close to beef fat hot pot
  base. I'd love to try this although the clarified butter does make a
  more expensive oil.

- [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddDwArEqeDQ): An okay video,
  mostly good for the spices.


# Updated Thoughts

## Infusion

I'm fairly sold on the multiple hot flashes for infusion. You start
with a very hot flash at 375F (190C) with some of the oil, then add
the remainder of the oil at 280F (140C). It helps to do the hot flash
with only half the chilies and then mix in the rest. I suppose you
could also try mixing a hot flash and a slow infusion, but that seems
like more work.

A really key insight that I learned was to add the sichuan peppercorns
*last* when the oil is at 212F (100C). Turns out their flavor doesn't
stand up to the heat. I have noticed that the tingly flavor was
lacking in my earlier batches, so this is a good tip.

I got around to getting a sous vide machine again, so I'll do an
experiment with that. I bet that could add a really nice layered
effect.

## Chili Mixture

In the videos I watched, I noticed that they were using a combination
of chili powder and chili flakes. This goes against my coffee
metaphor, but likely that's an issue with my metaphor and not with
their technique. I made a batch of oil with this combo of gochugaru
and chili flakes. It turned out pretty fantastic, so I'll have to do
more experiments here. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the flavor
is coming from the powder since it's so fine. I do think a key here is
that they carefully control the temperatures and only add a tiny bit
of the really hot oil to prevent the chilies from burning.

I do wonder if you could split infusion temps by chili size. Maybe the
powder is at a higher risk of burning?

## Ratio

The Chinese videos explicitly state that a 1 to 4 ratio of chilies to
oil is ideal, with a maximum of 1 to 5. I'll have to test that myself,
but that seems about right.

## Sous Vide vs Slow Infusion vs Hot Flash

I did another comparison experiment of 40g of gochugaru to 160g of
oil. I'm not sure if the ratio stated in the video is of weight or of
volume, I'd guess volume though. I made one batch sous vide at 154F
for 4 hours. Someone on Hacker News claimed this approximate recipe is
in Modernist Cuisine. I don't have the space or the money to spend 600
bucks on a print copy of Modernist Cuisine so I can confirm this, so
I'll take them at their word. I might see if I can get a copy at the
library.

I made another batch as a slow infusion at 200-220F, and a final batch
as a hot flash at 375F.

Tasting them, the hot flash batch was horribly bitter and clearly
burnt. It smelled amazing, like a really nice tadka or almost like
popcorn, but tasted absolutely terrible. This does seem to answer the
question of whether particle size can cause burning. The coarse chili
flakes tasted semi-burnt with a hot flash at 375F, but the fine
gochugaru tasted extremely burnt.

The slow infusion tasted decent. A little bit of that roasted,
slightly bitter flavor (interesting, hadn't noticed that in the coarse
chili flakes), but overall quite solid.

As for the sous vide, it was very mild, but perhaps with some subtle
aromatics? I wonder if it could have gone a little longer in the bath.

If I'm honest, the main conclusion I've found is that I might not love
gochugaru as the sole chili in an oil. It's very fine and therefore
too easy to burn.

To follow up, I also tried infusing sichuan peppercorns, since they
seem to extract better at lower temperatures. It didn't seem to
accomplish much either.

I'd also be curious to know if you could use the microwave to do chili
oil infusion.

One funny note, in a lot of the Chinese videos, they mention that the
different temperatures produce different flavors. The 375F flash
mostly produces spiciness and not much flavor. The lower temperature
flashes produce flavor and color. I hadn't put much stock into that,
but having done more experiments, I suspect they're not far off! The
high temperature infusions just don't have the same aroma.

# Indian Chili Oil

I tried making an Indian style chili oil, basically by infusing a
bunch of spices like coriander, cumin, mustard seeds, cardamom, curry
leaves, fenugreek, black pepper, chilies, cinnamon, hing, turmeric.

It smelled fantastic but it was slightly disappointing at the end. I
was debating whether to keep it like a tadka and not add too much
chili, or make it a proper chili oil with spices. I ended up straining
it, which left me with an aromatic oil, but not something very
impressive. Next time I'll make it into a proper chili oil with
flakes.

Also some spices dominated too much. I might omit the fenugreek and
hing or dial it down a lot.

One thing I love about Indian food are the whole spices that give you
a little bit of crunch and pop. Next time I'll keep the mustard seeds
and cumin seeds in for that.

Indian snacks are great for their crunch, I wonder if I could add some
to the oil to make a chili crisp. Hopefully they'd stay intact.

# Chili Crisp Recipe

I'm attempting to combine recipes to make my perfect chili crisp
recipe. For that, I'm taking the approximate ratios and techniques of
the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfFNXX_BMHo) and
combining them with [the seasonings and crispy additions of Sohla's
chili crisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GezQyVRQRzU).

First impressions: the first video makes *a lot* of oil. If the
translation is correct, it's 1 liter of oil and 250g of chilies. 250
grams is a lot of chilies! That basically exhausted my chili
supply. Also, that meant that I had to use more Xiao Mi La chilies
than I'd like, which made the oil **spicy**. I think going forward,
I'm gonna use a lot more mild chilies with an aromatic flavor.

I also put a lot of sichuan peppercorns which I also ground finely,
which made the tingly flavor really intense. I kind of like that
though! I might keep the intensity.

I added crispy shallots, peanuts, salt, pepper, sugar, mushroom powder
and MSG, per Sohla's recipe. I had to double the seasonings because
the oil was about twice the chili crisp recipe's batch size. It ended
up being way too much solids versus oil. Perhaps I can reduce the
shallots and add some more oil. That will dilute the chili flavor but
that's fine since it's pretty damn intense right now.

# Isolating Chili Flavors

I did another experiment where I made small batches of chili oil using
individual types of chilies, specifically xiao mi la, lantern chili
(deng long jiao), japones, er ting jiao, and byadagi. I tried to keep
it fairly consistent by using a standard ratio of 1 part chili to 5
parts oil, with a hot flash around 280F. I heated up a large batch of
oil and poured on the same amount to each batch of chilies. I did this
instead of heating up separate batches of oil because smaller volumes
of oil are harder to temp properly. I used a neutral oil, not
caiziyou, because I wanted a blank canvas to really taste the chilies.

Then I tried them each blind. My takeaways are first, whew, the
chilies that are on the spicier end like Xiao Mi La are waaaayy too
spicy to eat on their own. I had to cool off my palate with some
yogurt and take a break. Second, the chilies themselves don't tend to
have a lot of flavor and if they do, it's often quite vegetal. The
chilies I liked the most had a nice fruity, sweet flavor.

Here are the individual notes:

- Xiao mi la: As mentioned before, this totally blew out my taste
  buds. Not much to it beyond pure spice. Visually quite light in
  color.

- Lantern chili: These disappointed me. Chinese cooks cite them as
  adding a lot of fragrance to the oil, but they mostly tasted
  extremely vegetal. Not spicy at all. Perhaps they need to be roasted
  or fried? More on that later.

- Japones: A little on the spicy side, also quite vegetal. Again,
  these were cited as aromatic, so I'm surprised at the lack of flavor.

- Er ting jiao: Definitely spicy, second to the xiao mi la. A hint of
  smokiness to it. Not bad!

- Byadagi: Raisin-y, almost fruity. Very good!

I didn't test kashmiri, but I suspect they'd be very similar to byadagi.

Taking the experiment at face value, I'd lean towards using er ting
jiao, kashmiri and byadagi, with maybe a touch of xiao mi la for more
spice.

However, I do think this experiment is worth reproducing. For one, I
was quite lazy and didn't remove the seeds. That likely contributed to
the vegetal notes. Second, I didn't roast the chilies at all, which I
later read enhances the flavor of the lantern chilies. Third, I didn't
add salt, which might be why the flavors were so muted.

# Spices

The next experiment was based off of something I heard in the first
video. The narrator mentions that adding spices just detracts from the
chili flavor and isn't worth it. Let's try! I added some black pepper,
star anise, black cardamom, cumin, ginger, shallot and scallion to
oil, infused it for 1 hour 20 minutes at 200-250F. I then used the oil
to make the first video's recipe and compared it with a batch that
didn't use spices. And honestly? The oil didn't taste that different
from the oil without chilies. That kind of makes sense: caiziyou is
*really* strong in flavor. Adding on chilies and sichuan peppercorn,
it makes sense that there isn't much room left for the spices. Of
course it could just be my palate.

I then tried soaking the spices in alcohol then frying them in oil,
something I saw in a Wang Gang video. That caused a lot of bubbling,
but otherwise didn't seem to add much flavor either.

One thought I had is that a lot of recipes seem to rely on infusing
whole spices for a long time, but really, grinding the spices and
adding them to the chili flakes should get you more flavor. That's
what Sohla does in her chili crisp. So I tried that. I ground up some
cumin, black pepper, and fennel seeds, then mixed it with the chili
flakes before doing the hot flash. Lo and behold, that did add some
flavor! But again, the chili really dominates. If I were making this
oil commercially, I'd consider omitting it.

Of course this could be a matter of scale. I'm only adding about
10-15g of spices to about a liter of oil. I might want to increase the
quantity of spices.

It might also be worth reducing the amount of caiziyou, or even
omitting it if you want spices. It could be an xor situation.

# Ratio Revisited

I decided to try doubling the oil to be 2 liters for 250g of chili
flakes instead of 1 liter. The batch turned out decent. Eating a
spoonful with chili flakes feels about the same in intensity, but just
the oil in isolation is a little weaker. Perhaps I'll split the
difference and do 1.5 liters.

# Conclusion

I feel like I'm getting close to a definitive recipe on chili
oil. Here's a few more things I want to test:

- Add more ground spices.

- Figure out the right amount of salt, sugar, MSG.

- Should I use all caiziyou? It's very intense. A 50/50 caiziyou,
  neutral oil could work well and be more economical.

- I got my hands on the modernist cuisine sous vide recipe, so I might
  try that out. It requires a 24h infusion which ehh we'll see.

- Figure out a chili crisp recipe. I'm still hard pressed to beat
  Sohla's, but maybe there's a few fun tricks for an Indian style
  version.
