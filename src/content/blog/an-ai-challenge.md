Here's my proposal:

We challenge people to implement a significant technical project. We've already seen [a browser](https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents) and [a compiler for C](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler), but I'd be interested in something a little more greenfield. My idea would be a compiler for a hypothetical language, along with a formatter, linter, and build system. You'd be provided a spec for all of these and there'd probably be some comformance suite, but it'd explicitly be something not in training data. But that's just my idea! It could be a new database, an OS, really anything.

We give contestants about a week. People will be able to use any tools they like. Ideally, they'll get a bunch of free credits, so they can really go crazy.

Whoever gets the farthest, wins. If someone spins out of control, blows a few thousand in credits, and gets nothing, they get ridicule.

What do they win? Idk man. Could be a bunch of credits, could be money, could just be bragging rights. I could see some AI labs funding teams just to prove that their tools are the best. It'd be like how Ferrari competes in F1 races.

There's a few outcomes here, all of which would be great. The first is that everybody flames out in an embarassing mess of hallucinations and agentic sycophancy. That'd be pretty entertaining. The second is that some people do pretty well and either complete the benchmarks or get close. That'd be good data on how to use AI! The third is that everybody blows past the benchmarks and we end up with like 20 implementations of the language. In which case cool! We now have a new programming language and we've shown what AI can do.

Of course, this won't be a truly accurate way of ranking AI tooling. AI output is inherently non deterministic, and it's possible that a few poor decisions in the beginning create compounding mistakes and result in an unusually bad outcome. But if these competitions happen a few times and we start seeing consistent results, then that could be a really good signal.
