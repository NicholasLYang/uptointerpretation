Hi! This is my first post on the new Horribly Underqualified. I
created the original version of this blog last year. However, it
quickly fell out of use, partially because I found a job and partially
because I couldn't be bothered to maintain the Rails app it was built
upon. For this blog I've decided to take another route. I'm using
Hugo, a static site generator. That way I can have a blog with minimal
effort, while also having it look (significantly) nicer than the
previous iteration.

I might port over some writing from the old blog, but probably not
most of the posts. Hopefully I'll keep this blog relatively up to
date. If not, at least it's low maintenance.
