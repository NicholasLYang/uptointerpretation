Here are some worthwhile things to build.

## Parser

Parsers show up everywhere. Maybe not an official programming language
parser but definitely a basic ad-hoc parser. Plus so many interview
questions are basically parsing questions. Matching braces? That's a
parsing question. Building a calculator? That's a parser.

Knowing how to approach these problems in a systematic fashion,
whether that's recursive descent or a regular expression, makes life a
lot easier.

## Compiler

Of course, once you have that data from the parser, you should know
how to translate it. Compilers are excellent exercises on
understanding data transformation and data representation. You're
effectively designing mini-languages that help you derive information
about some data.

## Event Sourcing

Event sourcing shows up everywhere. Literally one of the biggest
realizations I had in computer sciene was Redux, Write Ahead Logging,
lots of distributed systems, actor models, etc. are all event
sourcing. Knowing how to persist state using logged events is so
essential to modern computing.
