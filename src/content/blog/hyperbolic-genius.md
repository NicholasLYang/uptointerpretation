There's a common trope in media where a character who is supposed to
be a genius (or honestly just very smart) has the most outrageous set
of credentials. Graduated from MIT at age 6. Has 7 PhDs. Brilliant at
5 independent subjects. Whatever.

These kind of bother me. Yes, I get it, the writers wanted a character
who's brilliant and giving them outrageous credentials is one way to
get that point across. But it's *lazy*. A character can be smart
without insane credentials. Giving them these ridiculous achievements
just turns them into a [Mary
Sue](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue). Plus
sometimes the authors go a little too far and give the characters
accomplishments that just sound absurd. 7 PhDs? Who even has 7
subjects they find that interesting? Or the requisite 20-something
years to accomplish that? You'd have to be delusional, or at least
very masochistic to get 7 PhDs.

I'm definitely thinking too much about this. But it does have an
influence. I don't think people genuinely understand what genius looks
like. Geniuses in media are always brilliant at 5 different subjects,
horribly tortured/quirky/mentally unstable. I'm not a genius but I do
know people who are. They're not brilliant at 5 different
subjects. Usually they're very good at 1, maybe 2 subjects. And often
times they're quite terrible at other subjects. Not always---there are
very well adjusted, capable geniuses.

One example I'd like to pick out is that of John Bardeen. Bardeen was
a very very smart guy. He is the only person to have won the Nobel
Prize in Physics twice, once for inventing the transistor, and once
for inventing BCS theory, a fundamental theory of
superconductivity. Let me emphasize, he invented the transistor, the
foundation of all modern electronics. To call him smart is to vastly
undersell his achievements.

However, Bardeen was a very normal fellow. He hosted cookouts with his
neighbors, most of whom didn't know about his achievements. He'd ask
people if they liked their hamburger bun toasted, as he liked his
toasted. He liked to play golf and go on picnics with his family. He
died at 82 due to heart disease.

There will never be a film about John Bardeen. He didn't write 5
operas while getting his 3rd PhD and drinking himself to death. He
didn't burn out at 27. His story is not an interesting one. It's a
rather melancholy thought that to be remembered, to be ordained as a
genius in popular culture, we need some amount of strife and
extremity. My only solace is knowing that Bardeen would likely not
care.
