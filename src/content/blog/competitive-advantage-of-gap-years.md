If there's one thing you should do coming out of high school, it's
take a gap year. Here's why.

# Maturity

Even if you spend your gap year doing nothing but playing video games,
it will still be worth it. In fact, it might be best to know that
given unlimited freedom, you're gonna spend it playing video
games. Better to realize that in a gap year than when paying 70k a
year.

Really, most college students are way too young and immature to be
going to college. College is a fundamentally different game than high
school. It's not necessarily more difficult---I had a much harder time
in high school than in college---but it operates under very different
rules. In high school, the goal for most academically minded students
is to get into college. This means getting good grades and adding to
one's application with extracurriculars. It's the same goal for
everyone. In college, the goal is dependent on what you want to do
with your life. If you want to go to medical school, it could be
getting good grades and letters of recommendation. If you want to
become a programmer it could be side projects and internships. A lot
of students could use a year of being deprogrammed from the high
school mentality.
