## Chili Flavor Experiment 2

So I tried another experiment on chili flavor. This time I focused
purely on lantern chilies. I wasn't impressed with my last go-around,
so I wanted to give them another shot. Chinese videos insist that they
add aroma and otherwise these videos have been spot-on with their advice.

I tried preparing the chilies four different ways: with seeds toasted
at 300F for 5 minutes, without seeds toasted at 300F for 5 minutes,
with seeds not toasted, and without seeds not toasted. I ground 25g of
the chilies to a medium fineness and flashed them with 100g of 280F
hot oil.

Some initial reactions:

- The chilies without seeds tended to grind a lot finer. This makes
  sense since the seeds are a little fiberous, so they'd hold up to
  the grinder a little more.

- The toasted chilies also were more brittle and ground
  easier. Therefore the finest was the toasted, no seeds while the
  coarsest was the untoasted, with seeds.

- Much more intense flavor notes in this batch. I wonder if last time
  my taste buds were just blown out from the other chilies.

- Contrary to what western videos say, which is to remove the seeds
  due to their toughness, the seeds are actually quite nice here! They
  add a nice chew and have a slight fruitiness to them. I wonder if
  that advice comes from using Mexican chilies which tend to have much
  tougher skins and seeds.

- I slightly prefer the toasted chilies due to a little more developed
  flavor. There's a little more fruitiness and less vegetal flavors.

- Therefore I think the favorite is toasted with seeds. Which, again,
  is how the Chinese videos advise preparing them. Another win for
  Chinese chili oil videos!

## Seasonings

I came up with a relative ratio of 4:2:1 for salt, sugar, and MSG. It
seems to work decently well, although it's hard to tell since none of
these really dissolve in oil. You could argue that's a good reason to
not use any seasoning, but I've found that the chilies can
occasionally taste a little bitter from the hot oil cooking them a
little too much. Some sugar balances that out and accentuates the
natural sweetness of the chilies, and once you add sugar, you want to
add salt and MSG to balance it. Of course, if you taste just the oil
and not the solids below, you won't get any of the seasonings, but you
also won't get the chili solids either, so it's no harm, no foul.

I know this makes my chili oil not a pure ingredient per se, but it
really does produce a better product.

I've also started to wonder about the specific types of salt. Right
now I'm using what I have on hand, which is granulated sugar, well,
toasted granulated sugar, Diamond Kosher Crystal salt, and this odd
sort of long pencil-y flakes of MSG. These are all pretty different in
size, and so I'm wondering if maybe the sugar is sinking to the bottom
while the salt is staying up top. I bet using larger flakes for
everything will keep everything a little more homogenous while also
adding some crunch.

## Spices

I keep on bumping up the spices. I'm up to: 16g of fennel seeds, cumin
and black pepper per 2 liters of oil. I'm starting to think in terms
of oil quantities, kinda like how bakers put everything in terms of
flour quantities.

By the way, how underrated is black pepper? It's such a fantastic
spice and adds so much to the oil.

## Indian Style Revisited

I did another attempt at the Indian style chili oil that I mentioned
in the previous post. This time I did a much more conventional chili
oil, where I adapted the multiple infusions technique from my Chinese
style oil. I bumped up the spices, adding lots of cumin, black mustard
seeds, cardamom, black pepper, and turmeric. I also spiked the oil
with some ghee to add some nuttiness. It does make the oil a little
more expensive (man, ghee is pricey), but it's worth it for the extra
flavor. If I could get mustard oil that's FDA approved, I'd also
consider using that.

I also used only Indian chilies, namely Kashmiri and Byadagi. Maybe I
can find a third to add another layer of flavor.

Overall it turned out very well! It's a little milder because it
doesn't have that top end note of Sichuan peppercorns. Maybe I can
find something else to replace it. But the nutty ghee flavor really
works and the extra spices make the solids really tasty. Plus there's
some extra texture from the mustard seeds and cumin.

## Streamlining

I've also streamlined the recipes a lot. For grinding, I've switched
back to a spice grinder for the fine chili powder. For the coarse
ground, I've started using a blender. It doesn't get as coarse as I'd
truly like, but it's good enough. Plus if you toast the chilies in a
dry oven, they get more brittle once coooled and therefore easier to
grind. You can also toast them in a wok with oil, but the oil makes it
harder to grind cleanly. After toasting, I let them cool down, then
break them up either with scissors or with my (gloved) hands. You can
see the basic idea
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZVjt2Lth0&t=50s).

Spices can all be ground together and mixed into the chili powder.

I've also tried scaling up the batches. I've managed to do 4 liters of
oil with no loss in quality. Anything past that and I might need a
bigger pot.

## Containers

As someone who has a lot of chili oil around, surprise surprise, I use
it a lot. When I use the oil, it's kinda annoying having to dig out an
extra spoon just to scope out the solids. After you're done, you have
a spoon that's oily, so you can't just put it down anywhere. I tend to
toss it in the sink, but then when I need to scoop out more oil, I
need another spoon.

I wonder if there was a way to eliminate the need to scoop it out? Fly
by Jing has a really great product, Sichuan Gold, that's essentially
just the fragrant oil, no solids. It's packaged in a hot sauce bottle
so you can shake it out like hot sauce. It's a brilliant idea. But I
like the solids! They are the most flavorful part.

Maybe there's some way to keep the particles suspended. Or some way to
integrate a spoon into the package. Or a package style that allows for
pouring from the bottom.

There's also an issue of consistent oil to solids ratio. If you're
filling jars, how can you get the right amount of solids and oil? And
since the salt/sugar/MSG isn't dissolved, there's also the risk that
you won't get the right amount of seasoning in each jar.
