Sometimes I think about how lucky I've been in my coworkers. People
talk online about incompetent and lazy coworkers, about
terrible code and poor documentation. I simply can't relate. 
In almost every place that I've
worked, that has not been the case. I've generally worked with
extremely competent people doing very good work. To the point where
sometimes I wonder if I just inhabit a different world from the
people online. Or perhaps I'm the incompetent person people keep
complaining about.

Sometimes I think about my coworker at a small startup who single
handedly built a sophisticated hyper optimized concrete syntax tree
library with an abstract typed interface on top. It reused nodes and
was one of the most impressive data structures I've seen.

Sometimes I think about my coworker who would structure every pull
request as a sequence of clean, beautiful commits that would implement
the feature like a story unfolding in front of you. I'd always feel so
bad giving my sloppy commit history with fixes and jumbled commits.
