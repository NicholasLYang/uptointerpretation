This blog is written by me, Nicholas Yang. I'm currently a software
developer at Vercel working on Turborepo. I like to watch movies,
travel and cook. I also like to write Rust.


The blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site
generator. It's hosted on Amazon's S3 service with Cloudfront and
Route 53. The domain was bought with Gandi.
