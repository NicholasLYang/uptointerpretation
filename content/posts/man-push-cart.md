The immigrant has been the subject and creator of films for quite a
while, whether it was behind the camera with Frank Capra and Billy
Wilder, Italian and Austrian immigrants respectively, or in front of
the camera, as in the heart breaking isolation of Diouana in Black
Girl (1966). However, there has been a recent rise in films by and
about immigrants. The Best Director Oscar was dominated by a dynasty
of Mexican-American directors termed "the Three Amigos": Alfonso
Cuaron, residence London; Guillermo Del Toro, residence Toronto and
Los Angeles; Alejandro Iñárritu, residence Los Angeles. Other
directors such as Chloe Zhao, Lulu Wang, and Ramin Bahrani have
achieved notable success. Furthermore, the immigrant has become a
central focus. Films such as Crazy Rich Asians are seen as tentpole
moments for Asian Americans. And yet, many, myself included, are not
satisfied. Too often the immigrant film is reduced to mediocrity or
forced to affect a foreignness, as if to imitate the
immigrant's country's national cinema.

The Farewell, directed by Lulu Wang, demonstrates this
affectation. The film starts with Billi (Awkwafina) in New York, her
hometown. Instead of seeing her in an American environment, with her
full confidence and bravado, we are immediately shipped to China,
where Billi becomes a more traditional, subdued presence due to the
language barrier. The film becomes a dramedy of manners, with a
traditional Asian banquet and Asian family dynamics. Right before this
transformation, we get a quick glimpse of a different film when Billi
has a witty exchange with a volunteer. She code switches, going from
subservient, good Asian granddaughter, into a persona more familiar to
fans of Awkwafina's rap career and jokes about quitting a job before
getting fired. When watching the film, I could not help but wonder
about the film that portrayed that Billi, in that situation. Why was
that not available to me?

Most Asian Americans are bitterly familiar with the answer to this
question. It is the classic issue of being a perpetual
foreigner. Producers and audiences alike are comfortable with Asians
who live in Asia; who speak Asian languages; who have thick, funny
accents. They are less comfortable with Asians who are witty; who
threaten their supremacy; and who live in their country.
