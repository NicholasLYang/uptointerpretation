title: "Google Should Do Better"

I recently finished my new-grad job search. Well recently as in within
the past year and a half. Hey blog posts take a while!

Anyways, in the process, I applied to a company that may be familiar
to some readers: Google. For many people, Google is their dream
company. They're world famous for hiring only the best and brightest;
they pay extremely well; and they offer some of the best working
conditions ever. And yeah, compared to the vast majority of companies,
all of these are true.

If that's the case, why did I turn down Google? To start, they were
simply too slow. Now, slowness is relative. If you've only applied to
big companies, you may be accustomed to applications that operate on
the scale of several weeks to a few months. You submit an application,
you wait a week or two, get an online asssessment (OA), wait another
week or two, do some phone interviews, wait for the interview
feedback, etc.

That's great and all, but it's way too slow. Do yourself a
favor. Apply to a startup. Or not even a startup. Apply to a company
that is not famous, not a big N or FAANGMULASS or MANGA or
whatever. Guess what? You'll probably finish the process in the time
it takes for Google to do one phone interview. When I interviewed for
Rome, it took maybe 2 weeks in total. They were transparent about
their process; they interviewed me both technically and personally;
and they got back to me within a day or two.

Sure, you say, but Google can afford to be slow, because they're
*Google*. They have all the aforementioned money, perks, and
prestige. That's all true. However, I've already worked for a big,
famous tech company; I interned at Microsoft in 2019. I had a great
time there. I learned a lot; I got to speak to some really cool
people; and I got paid pretty decently. But ultimately, it was like
any other job. As fun as Microsoft was, it wasn't life changingly
better than any other company.

I don't think I'm alone here. Sure, too the average person, Google is
extremely prestigious. But we're not talking about the average
person. We're talking about, well, Google-caliber programmers. The
thing about Google-caliber programmers is that a lot of them have
worked for Google or some place comparable. If they haven't, either
they're really early in their career, or they are not actively seeking
out those big companies. If it's the latter, Google needs to provide a
reason other than brand.

Why are these programmers not buying into Google? A lot of them are
aware of a very important fact: most work at Google is not
interesting. There's certainly fascinating work being done at
Google. People are writing compilers, browsers, machine learning
frameworks, etc. But there's also just a whole bunch of boring
maintenance work. It's the reality of working at a place like
Google. I can't tell you the number of people I know who got hired by
Google and ended up writing some kludgy Java for an internal
advertising dashboard.

And for a lot of people that's alright! They're making a great living
and sure the work's not interesting but they still get that trifecta
of prestige, money and perks. But for some programmers, the people who
really dive deep into coding, writing a bunch of kludgy Java is not
worth these benefits. They want to work on projects that they find
interesting.

For instance, I have carved out a niche in compilers. I've taken classes
on compilers; I've written a compiler at an internship; I've been
working on a compiler as a side project for a while. I like compilers
and my goal is to keep working in compilers to build up my expertise.

With Google's new graduate offer, I would not get that chance. I was
offered a position in a pillar, an extremely large division, of which
inside Google there are perhaps 5-6. Only a few weeks out from my
start date would I get to know my actual team. From my perspective
this is rather baffling. I'm interested in compilers and I'd consider
myself pretty decent at them for a new grad software engineer. It's
quite baffling that I can't be guaranteed a spot on a compilers team,
when I truly believe that would be the best way for me to help the
company.

It also sucks because there's some really cool looking teams at
Google. I was taking a look at JAX, which includes an optimizing
compiler for machine learning. That's super cool! If only I knew that
I would be working on JAX and not on some SLA metrics data pipeline.

Of course this system is by design. It's intended to handle a large
number of developers, most of whom don't care *that* much about their
team. The goal is to send developers all over the company, ensuring
that even the most boring teams get programmers.

Contrast that with Rome, where I knew that barring extreme changes to
the company, I would be unconditionally working on cool, interesting
technology.

And finally, here's one aspect that did *not* factor into my decision:
pay. I negotiated my pay with Rome and accepted what I deemed a fair
offer. When Google sent me their offer (3 weeks after I had accepted
Rome), I was surprised to see that it was lower than Rome's
offer. Indeed it was lower than Rome's initial offer *and*
Cloudflare's initial offer. However, between Google's stock valuation,
potential negotiation, and location (the offer was for Seattle), I'm
sure that Google could have come to a more competitive
offer. Regardless, I had happily accepted Rome and I don't renege on
offers.

That said, it surprised me that Google would offer so little. I
couldn't help but view it as a sign that Google assumed I would be
enamoured with their brand and accept blindly.
