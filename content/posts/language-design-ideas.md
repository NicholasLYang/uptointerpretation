Here are some things I'd think about if I were designing a language.

- Compilation unit. Tradeoffs of large vs small

- Reactivity. How can you change data and let listeners subscribe to
  those changes?

- Mutability (duh). How can you give mutability without creating bugs?

- How can you provide an error handling story that has simple, data
  structure oriented foundations, but also the ergonomics of
  exceptions?
