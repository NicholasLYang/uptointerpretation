I'm not a huge fan of school. It's taken me a long time to realize
this. I've wanted to be someone who's a fan of school, who can get
good grades and win accolades. But it's just not the case.

I'm not a huge fan of school because school is fundamentally not skill
based. It's funny, because so many subjects are skill based. I've had
many teachers say "this subject is different, because it's a skill and
therefore you need to practice it", not realizing that this applies to
almost every subject. And yet, we don't teach skill. There's attempts
to approximate it; showing work on a math test or programming projects
can potentially demonstrate skill. But they're still only an approximation.
