What separates the super successful, 10k GitHub stars, front-page of
Hacker News side project from the abandoned project that languishes on
your GitHub, a starter template with a couple commits from June of
2021? I'd say it's whether or not you revisit the project.

In a perfect world we'd all start projects that we work on every day,
make fantastic progress, and ship within a couple weeks to thousands
of users and adoring comments on Hacker News and Reddit. Unfortunately
that doesn't really happen. You pick up a project, perhaps you buy a
domain name, maybe build a little bit, and then...you get a little
busy, maybe you get hooked on a book, maybe you find a different thing
to build, maybe you just get a little lazy. The result is an abandoned
project.

And for some people, this is the end state. They abandon the project
and continue this cycle in a few weeks with a new project. This is
pretty understandable. Starting new projects feels so fresh and
exciting! You have a new idea, and this time the idea will really
work, and you'll have that aformentioned perfect rocketship
project. And that old project is so icky and boring. It's a reminder
of your laziness, your supposed failure. Besides, you started it with
like, React 16 with create-react-app, shouldn't you be using Svelte
with Vite? And it's so fun to write those first lines, get your schema
set up, see those first bits of UI on the page. Much more fun than
having to read old code.

I get all of this. That's why my GitHub is full of old, abandoned
projects. But the projects that I am arguably most proud of, that I
bring up in interviews and keep on my resume, those projects are
almost always ones that I have revisited. I have dug those projects
out of the ground, brushed off the cobwebs, and kept them going.

Brushing off the cobwebs is actually a good piece of first advice. I
find that this is the best way to get acclimated to a project
again. Run your linter, update the libraries (within reason), fix any
odd issues. I often feel a little daunted when I approach a project
again, but any glance at the codebase dispells me of this
feeling. There's always some housekeeping, something productive to be
done that will be satisfying once it's finished. Memories will start
to come back like "ohh yeah I need to refactor the login flow" or "ah
yeah this bug was a problem". You'll get back into the groove in no time.

The second bit of advice is to be a little stubborn around the
idea. It's so easy to nitpick your idea and decide that no, it's not
the right plan. This is especially true if you want this project to
actually gain users. It's too easy to get in your head about whether
users will like the idea. In reality, you can't ever know if something
will get users without A. talking to users, and B. shipping something
and seeing if they like it. You can certainly do A., but B. is the
ultimate test. If you're getting cold feet in the middle of a project,
push forward and resist the temptation to switch. That process of
nitpicking is just a natural part of being too close to an idea. Much
as the grass is always greener on the other side, the idea not chosen
is always better.

In general you should prioritize forward movement to any doubt. Don't
worry if the tech stack is a little old. Don't worry if the code is
messy. Just keep going and you might find yourself falling in love
with the project again.

Really this is about a mindset change. Instead of seeing a project as
dead, abandoned, forgotten, etc., you should see it as momentarily on
pause. You should see these stops as part of a project's
lifecycle. It's okay if something doesn't take off immediately. It's
okay if you lose interest for a bit. Much as overnight success takes a
few years, rocketship acceleration might take a few starts and stops.

The best example I have of revisiting projects is actually this
blog. Almost everybody has a blog that they've thrown together. Some
people build the blog, abandon it, and never publish anything. Or they
write a draft or two, but it never gets anywhere. I know that I have
dozens upon dozens of drafts laying around. The difference is that I
constantly revisit half-written, abandoned posts, polish them up, and
ship them. Heck, this post was originally written a few weeks ago, I
just scanned through my drafts for a post to ship and decided to
finally give it an ending. I suspect many successful blogs work on
this rediscovery model.

So go find a project that is languishing in your computer, abandoned
and forgotten. Brush it up; keep building; and ship it!
