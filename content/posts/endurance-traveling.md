When I started solo traveling a couple years ago, I became obsessed
with techwear. Techwear is clothing that is "optimized" in some
fashion. It uses fabrics that dry faster, breathe better, offer more
stretch, more durability, etc. The brand that I became enamored with
was [Outlier](https://outlier.nyc). They offer Merino wool t-shirts
that could be worn for days on end, shorts that can be used as
swimming trunks, specialty button ups that are lighter than
linen. 

However, as I went on my first solo trip, I made a few
observations. First, the clothing was not life-changing-ly,
earth-shattering-ly better than my normal, pedestrian cotton shirts
and cotton chinos. Oh sure, I *could* wear the shirts for 4 days on
end. But did I want to? And sure, I could hand wash the pants and have
them dry quickly, but I could also just spin dry
them. Newsflash---washers and dryers exist in 95% of the
world. Second, the clothing felt, well...wrong. Not that it was
uncomfortable. Far from it, the clothing was extremely
comfortable. But it just wasn't what I wore at home. And while Outlier
puts a lot of effort into making the clothing look normal and not
tech-y, the clothing felt less a fashionable garment and more an
expensive, kinda dorky gadget.

When I made it back home, I took an inordinate amount of pleasure in
wearing my normal, impractical clothing. A cotton oxford shirt and a
pair of black chinos may not breathe as well, may not resist smells
and stains as easily, but they were normal to me.

I was certainly not alone in this pursuit of optimization. Techwear is
only a small subset of the traveling "hacks" that are peddled around
the internet. People discuss the optimal places to go, using the
optimal flight scheme and stopping at the optimal restaurants to
eat. These optimizations are often quite useful; nobody should pay 600
dollars for a flight from New York to Paris. But at the same time,
this optimization obsession lends an intensity, a certain level of
stress to traveling that is not necessary. 

For an example of this stress, simply go to a tourist heavy city; New
York, Paris, Rome, etc. and look for a nuclear family, often American,
rushing from attraction to attraction. The parents are attempting to
stick to their strict timeline, sweating and stressing in the
process. The children are tired and hungry, bored and confused at
their panicking parents. 

Why does this optimization cause so much stress and misery? Because
the family is **outside their baseline**. They are sleeping in an
unfamiliar place, eating unfamiliar food and demanding a far stricter
schedule than they would ever consider at home. Now, for the short
burst trips that Americans love, the weekend dashes in Paris or the
week long European frenzy, this is perfectly fine. But past a few days
and this system breaks down.

In programming, there's a commonly cited quote from Donald Knuth that
"premature optimization is the root of all evil". These tricks of
techware clothing, packed schedules and tourguide obsessions are the
premature optimizations of traveling.

What's the alternative? For this, we need to look far down under to
Australia and New Zealand. Aussies and Kiwis travel for extremely long
periods of time. A short trip for an Australian is maybe a month
long. In basically every hostel I've stayed in, there's been an Aussie
or a Kiwi cooking. At first, I thought this was just out of frugality,
and partially it is. But I recently realized that cooking allows
them to eat something closer to home, bringing them back to their
baseline. It's comforting and sustaining at the same time.

Basically, to lessen stress while traveling, do what you like to do at
home. For each of us, this is different. For instance, I don't
particularly like sightseeing as much as eating and wandering. So I
don't try to force myself into sightseeing just because I'm
traveling. If you don't like eating too much different food, eat food
from home. If you want to bring a piece of clothing that isn't super
practical, but makes you feel at home, go for it[^1]! There's no way
to "win" traveling. And if someone tries to judge your trip because
you didn't see site X or do activity Y, well fuck them. It's your trip.

## A Quick Coda on Backpacks

I'm very skeptical of the gigantic backpack that swings around like an
oversized hump slamming into the poor people who veer into the
wearer's path. For a very niche, very specific trip, those backpacks
are useful, say offroading in the jungles of Thailand. But if you're
doing a Interrail trip through Europe with the occasional bus, y'know
what's super handy?  Wheels. I've spent far too much time sweating
with a heavy fucking bag weighing me down, desperately trying to find
the train station. A suitcase with wheels, while less "ooh look at me
I'm an adventurer", is much more maneuverable and ergonomic.

Huge backpacks are the perfect example of premature optimization in
traveling. Unless you're doing a trip that requires going to
destinations without roads---mind you, not lack of paved roads, but
lack of *roads* in general---then a suitcase will work just fine.

Honestly I suspect the backpacks are more for the self image of a
brave adventurer, literally "backpacking" around the world. Great for
Instagram, less great for your back.
