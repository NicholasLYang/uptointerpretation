There's a common refrain about Chinese food, that it must only be good
when it's from a restaurant ["in the hood, with bullet proof glass,
[that hasn't] changed their oil in 4
weeks"](https://old.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/15frx9w/the_best_chinese_restaurants_are_in_the_hood_with/),
where ["a nine year old takes your
order"](https://old.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/w336aq/it_isnt_a_good_chinese_take_away_unlesskeep_it/igtvnx6/),
with ["dirty floors, tables, and
counters"](https://twitter.com/CamBlunt/status/1544175080435064833). Americans
seem to relish this image of a Chinese restaurant as a dirty, cheap,
possibly illegal place. In fact many people in these threads seem to
associate expensive Chinese food with fusion, with inauthenticity,
with being a rip-off.

I don't mean to shame people for their preferences. Chinese-American
food is an art unto itself, and often rooted in a fascinating mixture
of immigration and adaptation. Likewise, these restaurants are run by
Chinese immigrants and the people frequenting them are directly
supporting Chinese Americans. That's really great.

But I do think it flattens Chinese food into a single form. And it's a
form that many Chinese themselves would not recognize. Yes, Chinese
food can be cheap. But it also can be wonderfully expensive, with some
of the most luxurious, beautiful banquet food in the world. Yes,
Chinese food can be greasy and a little "dirty", so to speak, but it
can also be light and delicate. In fact some of the very dishes that
Americans love like sweet and sour pork or kung pao chicken display
these exact qualities, but were turned into sweeter, simpler versions
to fit the American palate.

And because Chinese food is flattened into this one form, the metric
for evaluating Chinese food is very much one-dimensional. Is the food
cheap? Do they make good egg rolls? Are the tables sticky?

There's also the matter of class. It's rather notable that
authenticity and cheapness are intertwined in people's minds. Real
Chinese food must be cheap. But why? Chinese food uses the same
ingredients as any other cuisine. There's no magical secret as to why
Chinese food is cheap.
