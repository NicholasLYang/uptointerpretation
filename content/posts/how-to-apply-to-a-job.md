I used to write a career advice blog, mostly for other NYU students. I
stopped writing it because well, I graduated and stopped caring about
NYU. But recently I've had to help some people apply to jobs, so I
figured I'd write a post for old time's sake.

# Just Apply

This is really the only rule you need to follow. Just apply to the
damn job. The odds that you get the job when you don't apply
are precisely zero. When you do apply, the odds are at least non-zero.

Often times people will push back saying they need to fix up their
resume or work on their portfolio or do a certification. These are all
bullshit reasons to not apply. There is always something more you can
do. But job applications are such a random process that it's highly
unlikely that a single change will make a difference. Get the bare
minimum, i.e. a resume, and apply.

# Don't Worry About Prep

Often people will say that they need to do some interview prep. I say
apply and then do the prep. Applications take time to
process. Interviews take time to schedule. It's really unlikely that
you'll get an interview within two weeks of an application. You can do
the prep in that time.

Also, it's not the end of the world to prep for interviews by
interviewing. There's so many programming jobs out there. You can
afford to use a couple as practice.

# The Difficulty of Application is Inversely Proportional to Response Likelihood

If you only apply via 1-click job applications, don't be surprised if
you get very few responses. Any person can click on those buttons, so
those jobs get flooded with thousands of applications in seconds. The
odds are against you.

The hardest application is a warm intro, i.e. a friend introduces you
to someone who's hiring. That requires an existing network[^1] and the
willingness to ask for intros. You'll almost always get a
response.

[^1]: Which is a privilege not many have, especially when starting
    out.

The second hardest is an email with a carefully crafted, honest
message about why you'd be an excellent fit. This is hard because
first, writing out a thoughtful email takes time (although with the
rise of ChatGPT, perhaps that has changed), and second, because most
people are not an excellent fit for a job. That's not an insult. A lot
of people are very good fits. But an excellent fit may be something
like "I worked at a competitor", or "I've built a side project related
to this field".

By the way, this is usually what a cover letter is supposed to, well,
cover. But cover letters are tricky. I'm not convinced they're helpful
in a normal application, because it's just another thing that won't
get read if your resume is filtered out. But if you're sending an
email, the cover letter is the email itself, and so the person has a
much higher chance of reading it.

When writing this email, keep it short. Don't recap your entire
resume. It should be a short addition to your resume that emphasizes
your specific connection to this role. If you don't have that
connection, don't write a cover letter.

This isn't to say that you should solely apply via emails and
connections. Maybe when you're established enough, but in the
beginning you will be sending regular applications. Applying after all
is still a numbers game. Just make sure to submit them on the actual
company's job portal. Don't use any third party applications.

## Get to a Human Being

Almost all companies use some sort of filtering system for
applications. It's the job form of DDoS protection. Therefore, you
should not take it personally if you get rejected. It's just a random
computer system doing random things.

This is the correllary to the above. If you apply via the easiest way,
you're probably just gonna get filtered. If you can get to a human
being, whether that's a recruiter, a hiring manager, or even an
employee, that will increase your chances significantly.

Email is really underrated as a job application format. It allows you
to apply in your terms and put your best foot forward. People read
their email every day and often will read something clearly from a
real human being.
