There's been a fascinating transition within food media. Take the Bon
Appetit video [Claire Makes Soup
Dumplings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMYRjp4h0y0). The video is
shot with fast cuts, loud music, and an authoritative, clearly
instructional style. The host, Claire Saffitz, is edited and framed to
have very little personality. She speaks in a clearly scripted manner
that is focused entirely on the recipe. She's also dressed in a rather
formal manner, including pale, severe makeup, and a white dress
shirt. The music is quite literal and bordering on offensive in using
vaguely oriental themes for a video on soup dumplings. The intertitles
are the traditional, carefully modeled photos that one would see in a
food magazine. The location is also rather abstract. Claire is in a
generic kitchen with no indication of place or time.

One can draw a comparison between this form and that of a prototypical
classic Hollywood film. Both use music in the most direct obvious
form; in the case of Hollywood films, aggressive, dissonant music to
indicate tension. The actors exhibit formal, heighted acting. The
locations are sets with very little natural presence. And the plot in
both avoids direct reflexivity. The characters do not acknowledge the
fourth wall. Even though Claire is ostensibly talking to the camera,
she is not acknowledging the game that she is playing, she is not
acknowledging that this is a formal structure that she is to playing
along inside.

Contrast this with the Bon Appetit video [Molly Makes Roast Chicken
and Potatoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TODJBQ0tnow). The
difference in style is immediately noticable. The video is shot in the
actual test kitchen for Bon Appetit. This provides a few novel
aspects. First, it allows for a very concrete sense of time and
place. We understand that this is the kitchen for Bon Appetit in the
World Trade Center. Indeed we can even notice that this specific video
was shot after dark. Second, it provides other characters for the
video. Because the video is shot in the real test kitchen, other Bon
Appetit employees---including other hosts of videos---show up in the
background. Sometimes these are just short cameos for devoted
viewers. Other times these characters show up in the teaser at the
beginning, as in this video, and often at the end to taste the
food. And third, the location provides a sense of space that can be
explored within the video. Often times hosts will move from an
introduction in front of the cutting board to a demonstration at the
stoves and finally a conclusion back at the cutting board. In other
videos a host may bring the camera crew with them to the walk-in
fridge or even an office. With each video, the viewer begins to
comprehend the space further.

Another difference is the demeanor of the host. Molly speaks in a
casual, loosely scripted manner. Her delivery has some filler words
and some idiosyncrasies. She also acknowledges the fourth wall. For
instance, she discusses directly the swap that she uses in the
video. The swap is a common trick in food videos where a host will
have a dish that is already finished---in some complex cases there
will be multiple swaps for each stage of the recipe---so that they can
avoid having to cook the entire dish from scratch while enduring the
vissicitudes of filming a video such as multiple takes and awkward
timing. In most traditional food videos the swap is not
acknowledged. The host will go from a raw chicken to a cooked one, and
claim it's been 45 minutes, creating the illusion that the editor
simply removed 45 minutes of the host standing around. Molly instead
directly admits that it has only been 5 minutes, and that there is
another chicken that has been in the oven already.

The editing and sound design is also extremely pulled back. There are
no fast cuts, no aggressive music. While Claire's video starts with a
very quick statement of purpose, and then immediately jumps into the
recipe, Molly's video starts with an in media res moment with a
coworker, and then slowly introduces the recipe.

These changes are indicative of a shift in the overarching goals of
food videos. The traditional approach is that of an oracle, an
abstract authority figure, telling, nay, ordering the viewer on how to
properly execute a recipe. The video must enforce this sense of
quality and eliteness. The modern approach is far more about ensuring
that the viewer is comfortable making the dishes. By letting viewers
take a peek under the curtain, by letting the hosts exhibit more
personality, Bon Appetit is hoping to make viewers see the recipes as
feasible, as attainable.

It's important to note that in neither case do these videos actually
teach most cooks how to execute the recipe. They do not give precise
measurements or timings for recipes. Instead, the goal is to provide a
narrative for the recipe. Why should you make the recipe? What are the
key goals of the recipe? In the case of the soup dumplings this is the
juicy, soup filled interior, while with the chicken it is the
luxurious, schmaltzy chicken fat. They also provide guidelines for how
the recipe should progress. By watching the video, the viewer can
compare their chicken to Molly's, their dumplings to Claire's and
ensure that they are on the right track.

The key difference is that in Claire's video, there is still this facade of
