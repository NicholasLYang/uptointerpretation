There's a common refrain about Chinese food, that it must only be good
when it's from a restaurant ["in the hood, with bullet proof glass,
[that hasn't] changed their oil in 4
weeks"](https://old.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/15frx9w/the_best_chinese_restaurants_are_in_the_hood_with/),
where ["a nine year old takes your
order"](https://old.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/w336aq/it_isnt_a_good_chinese_take_away_unlesskeep_it/igtvnx6/),
with ["dirty floors, tables, and
counters"](https://twitter.com/CamBlunt/status/1544175080435064833). Americans
seem to relish this image of a Chinese restaurant as a dirty, cheap,
possibly illegal place. In fact many people in these threads seem to
associate expensive Chinese food with fusion, with inauthenticity,
with being a rip-off.

I don't mean to shame people for their preferences. Chinese-American
food is an art unto itself, and often rooted in a fascinating mixture
of immigration  and adaptation. Likewise, these restaurants are run by
Chinese immigrants and the people frequenting them are directly
supporting Chinese Americans. That's really great.
