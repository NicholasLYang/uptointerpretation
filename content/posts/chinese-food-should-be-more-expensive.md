Chinese food should be more expensive. It is a fantastic cuisine with
thousands of years of tradition; incredibly intricate, beautiful
technique; and amazing ingredients that require months if not years of
fermentation. It should cost as much as any other cuisine.

This statement shouldn't be that controversial. Indeed it's not in
most places. But it's a statement I struggle with. Yes, Chinese food
should be more expensive. However by making it expensive, Chinese
restaurants would be alienating the very people they aim to
serve. They'd be alienating the second generation Asian American kids
who rely on 5 dollar roast pork to feed themselves after school, the
families who go to dim sum on Sunday mornings, people who may work in
food service themselves.

Therein is the paradox. We need to charge more for Chinese food to
value Chinese labor, but until we value Chinese labor, any increase to
food prices hurts Chinese people.

This paradox is an extension of the William Gibson quote: "the future is "
