How do you become a 10x developer? There's a whole essay on the flawed
nomenclature of a 10x developer. Let's put that aside.

So how do you become one? Most people would give some sort of answer
based around talent. That's probably somewhat true, but we can't do
much about talent. Either you have it or you don't. So what can you do
much about? I'd say practice and psychology.

Practice is an obvious one. If you write more code, you get
better. However, I think people misunderstand practice. First, I think
people misunderstand how much time top talent puts in. It's a lot. If
you want to be a really good programmer, you probably have to code a
lot. Not so much that you burn out, but definitely outside the
traditional working/studying hours.

This may offend some people's sensibilities. And I want to be clear: I
am not saying you need to write this code for an employer. I am also
not saying being a 10x developer is a good thing. It's a particular
life choice for a particular person. For the person who values a
variety of interests, a vibrant social life, and downtime, being a 10x
developer may not be the ideal lifestyle. And really, there's a larger
conversation about focusing so much on these single
qualities.

The second part that people misunderstand about practice is the type
of practice one should be doing. A 10x developer is doing ambitious work.
