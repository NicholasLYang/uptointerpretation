Programming language designers should care about usability.

That should be an obvious statement. Unfortunately it's not. Too many
programming languages designers ignore usability and wonder why other
languages are more popular. Even worse, some designers take pride in
their language's lack of popularity, as if it demonstrates that their
language is above the unwashed masses.

Usability means good error messages, good documentation, good
tooling. Usability means a beginner friendly community. Usability
means understanding that yes, syntax does matter.

I've wondered why this is so hard to understand. There's a few
suspects. For one, usability is not often a concern in math. There's
an extremely unsympathetic sensibility to a lot of mathematics. The
language is often quite formal; non-single letter variables are
exceedingly uncommon; and the prevailing philosophy is that lack of
comprehension can be solved by simply more effort. A lot of functional
programmers come from math backgrounds, so it makes sense that they
would inherit these sensibilites.

Why do these sensibilities prevail? I posit that there's a difference
of internal aesthetic versus external aesthetic. As this is my own
terminology, I should probably explain what I mean. Aesthetic refers
to a sense of beauty or elegance. However, there are two main ways in
which this beauty manifests. Beauty can manifest in an external
manner, i.e. in a manner easily visible to all. An elegant dress or a
beautiful photograph has external aesthetic. It can also manifest in
an internal manner, i.e. in a manner that is only apparent after some
process of analysis. A really smart proof of a theorem, or a
minimalist poem has internal aesthetic.

Both aesthetics are valid. Indeed framing this as a dichotomy is not
entirely accurate. It's more a spectrum of sorts. Nonetheless, there
are certainly groups of people who prioritize one aesthetic over the
other. A group of stereotypical nerds may prioritize the abstract
beauty of a well written program over the more concrete beauty of
their clothes. A bunch of internet influencers may care more about
their looks than the underlying beauty of their content.

Again, though, I am falling into a dichotomy. One trend I've observed
is that the once Manichean split of internal aestheticians and
external aestheticians is dissolving. Nerds are learning to dress well
and Instagram influencers are playing chess or learning to code. This
is a great trend and we see it reflected in programming
languages. Rust is a language that personifies external and internal
aesthetics. The language has an elegant type system and semantics
which provide the internal aesthetic, but it also has the easy to use
tooling and documentation that provides external aesthetic.
