We've seen these posts before: "I'm 13 and I'm learning Rust", "I'm 15
and I built a website", ["I'm 20 and I'm the king of
Macedon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great). They're
kind of nice! It's great seeing someone so young doing such
interesting work. I certainly didn't have the knowledge or ambition to
accomplish what some of these developers have done.

And I should really leave this on that positive note, but every time I
see one of those posts, I get this...itch, this...discomfort. We
should give these developers all the praise they deserve, but I'm not
sure we should celebrate the phenomenon that causes them to flaunt
their age. Underneath the innocuous display of one's work is this
undertone, this message; behold my precociousness. Behold my youth.

What's wrong with celebrating precociousness? Let's start with me. As
many programmers, I was always a little advanced academically. I took
honors classes and accelerated programs. In honors classes, there's
this universal phenomenon where each level claims to be teaching the
next level. Precocious middle schoolers learn high school
math. Precocious high schoolers learn college math. Sometimes that
very well may be true. I learned a solid amount of linear algebra in
high school.

But when I stepped back and thought about the whole system, it seemed
kind of weird. Why do we need to keep this weird charade where high
school students learn College Math™[^1]? What even is College Math™?
Why do we encourage by assigning arbitrary levels and then claiming
you're above that level? What do we encourage?

[^1]: Aka APs

We encourage level-ism. We encourage this idea that you always need to
be at the next level, ahead of the pack.

But this breaks down. Now that I'm in college and almost out, what's
my level? I'm not learning graduate level programming---frankly that's
not a thing. I'm certainly learning interesting, challenging
topics. But it's no longer a level. I'm no longer special or
precocious.

This obsession with levels can also be prohibitive. If you've been
conditioned to always be ahead, starting a new area where you're at
par or *gasp* behind will seem like a daunting task. Which is a
shame. I took a drawing class the other semester and it was delightful
being behind. There's a joy in knowing that you are not required to be
at anybody's level.

The extreme example of this is a gap year. I took not one, but two gap
years, putting me at *gasp*, two years behind my high school
classmates. Is that a big deal? Not at all. I still accomplished a lot
in those two years. I just happen to be graduating two years
later. I've also gotten to do stuff that many could not, such as work
on my mental health, travel, and do more internships. Through the
lense of levelism, my gap years have put me behind, have made me less
accomplished. I don't think that's a healthy or accurate view.

Levels can also lead to jealousy. Any instance of someone younger
doing something better is a sign that you're not doing enough, that
you're behind. Which is absurd. I should be celebrating people who are
doing cool stuff while also appreciating my own cool stuff.

I don't want to discourage anybody who is 13 and ambitious. Keep on
going! But don't focus too much on your age. There will come a time
where you don't have your precociousness, where there will be people
who are younger building more impressive stuff, where you will be
adrift with just your skills and your ambition. I hope you do well.

As for the rest of us, we should keep on encouraging the young, but
why not the old? I'd love to see a "I'm 73 and I wrote a website"
