There is a gigantic pool of talented engineers that nobody has figured
how to tap into. They're the people who don't apply to jobs. If you
can find these people, you can build an incredible team.

It's a pretty obvious statement to say that you only get candidates
who apply, but that belies a major truth: A lot of people really
really really hate applications. They will do anything to avoid
filling a form. Some of the most talented people I've known, people
who will dive into massive technical problems with no hesitation, they
struggle with filling out a simple form.

And really, what incentive do people have to apply to jobs if they
already have one? More money? What if the person doesn't care about
money? A lot of good programmers aren't exactly materialistic. And
even those who are, may not have such a burning need that they'll
apply to a job. Remember, applications are *scary*. They're tedious,
require writing, and can lead to rejection. Anxiety and avoidance are
powerful preventative forces.

This is the value of outbound recruiting. You can get to the people
who don't apply.

I don't think people internalize this because the people who become
hiring managers and startup founders tend to be ambitious. Ambitious
people apply to jobs.

You may be thinking, hey, this is what a recruiter does, no? Reach out
to people and ask them to apply. And sure, that is true. But
recruiters reach out to specific kinds of people. They reach out to
people with notable big tech companies on their resume. They reach out
to people who have a LinkedIn or an active GitHub account. These are
the obvious candidates. What you need to find are the less obvious
candidates. There's a lot of them.

Take government contracting. There's a whole industry of software
developers working in old technologies, getting underpaid with worse
benefits. A lot of them don't keep an active GitHub or LinkedIn
presence. Why would they when they can't talk about the work? And yes,
it's a stable job, but when the "unstable" job pays twice the salary,
I think you could convince some to leave.  You could probably get a
solid bunch of people simply by poaching government contractors.

Some of you may be sneering that the government contractors are
clearly the lesser programmers and that's why they're in
contracting. I don't know about that. For one, tech interviews are not
these magical mysterious processes that only the talented can
pass. They're quite literally a test that you can study and
pass. Second, it's not like these people are applying to big tech
every year and getting rejected. They're probably not applying in the
first place.

Of course, there are other reasons why people don't apply. I've talked
to people who assume the jobs can't pay as well as they do. Dan Luu
[has mentioned](https://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/) that he didn't
think big tech salaries were real until he got a big tech job. Others
may not be aligned with the company's values. But these issues are
rarely total blockers. Usually they're just enough of an impedance to
prevent someone from applying. If you reach out to them, they may
think differently. After all, a recruiter from a big tech company
reaching out is flattering. Even the most cynical enjoy flattery.

Really inertia is what we're discussing. People have a lot of inertia
in their lives that they rarely fight. It's why some of the best CS
schools are state schools. Talented students hate applying to college,
so they pick the easiest, simplest option, i.e. their local state
school. Those same talented students hate applying to jobs, so they
take the first job that a friend offers, or that they see at a career
fair.

I'm not exactly sure how to find these candidates. Maybe it involves
some amount of snooping in public spaces like GitHub or reddit. Maybe
it requires reaching out to professors. Maybe you need to keep an ear
to the ground for companies that are doing more interesting work than
they should be. But if you can find them, you'll get some damn good
engineers.
