If you go on the internet and look at any sort of video that purports
to show Italian cooking, you'll find an army of people, both Italian
and not, decrying the video as not authentic, as misrepesenting the
food, as lies. The sins are usually that of additional
ingredients. Garlic in carbonara. Olive oil in cacio e pepe. Fish
sauce in bolognese.

In the commentor's mind, each dish has a singular recipe that can
never be altered. Carbonara must consist of eggs, guanciale, pecorino
romano, and black pepper. Cacio e pepe must be black pepper and
pecorino. Nevermind that carbonara is most likely created from the
bacon and eggs that American army rations contained. Nevermind that
there are various regions of Italy with their own unique cuisine that
are not always known to one another. And nevermind that it's extremely
unlikely that Italian households would all know to stick to the same
super specific recipes when ingredients were not always available and
not subject to any sort of quality control or regulation. Anyways, I
digress. If you want to read specifically about the myth of Italian
food, check out [this

Of course, this isn't limited to Italian food. I wrote a post on chili
oil and received a few comments seemingly disgusted with the idea that
I'd try to take an experimental or innovative approach to chili oil,
claiming that Chinese grandmothers have perfected such a recipe and
wouldn't dare overanalyze it.

First of all, that's rather sexist and condescending. Chinese
grandmothers can be innovative and inquisitive. The stereotyping of
them as simple beings ruled by tradition is both ignorant and
incorrect. I have no doubt plenty of Chinese grandmothers tinker with
their chili oil recipes.

But more importantly, how did these commentors think chili oil arose
in the first place? Like how did chili oil become a thing? Or what
about carbonara? How did that become a dish?

Implicit in a lot of commentors' minds is this pseudo-creationist idea
that foods just pop into existence in an immutable form. At one point
people had no carbonara, and at some point carbonara popped into
existence and forever stayed the same. Of course, that's not how it
went. Likely there was some precursor carbonara that had some similar
elements, maybe scrambled eggs instead of emulsified egg, maybe
whatever cheese happened to be around instead of pecorino. That
carbonara eventually became the modern carbonara through
evolution. And it's quite possible that yes, carbonara will eventually
evolve into something else entirely. English carbonara has peas and
ham, but that makes it no less carbonara than Italian carbonara.

It's like language. Language is constantly evolving. Claiming that
there is a singular form of English is absurd. There's a reason
dictionaries change their definitions.

What's tricky about food specifically is that we love to create this
mythos around food. People eat up the image of an Italian cuisine that
has been the same for generations, that has these strong, specific
traditions, that is extremely regional. We love to imagine that some
Chinese grandmother created this one perfect chili oil recipe that
will be faithfully recreated forever. We love to imagine that the
pizza we eat in Naples is the same pizza that was eaten hundreds of
years ago.
