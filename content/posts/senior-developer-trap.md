I've noticed this pitfall with senior developers. This is not true for
all senior developers, just a particular genre. I'm talking about the
type of senior developer who focuses on scalability, who is obsessed
with code quality, who wants to build something that is engineered
"right". These all seem like great qualities, no?

For most companies these are indeed great qualities. But at an early
startup, these are not the qualities that one wants. Scalability
almost never matters. Worrying about scalability is like worrying
about [bullet holes in a plane's
wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). The startups
that have to scale are the ones that succeed. Sometimes these
developers can point to situations where they had problems scaling or
with code quality. What they don't understand is that these are the
problems of success.

In a sense this is an extension of the second system effect. These
developers have encountered these issues and are now focused on
avoiding them at all costs. The key phrase here is "at all
costs". While it's not necessarily bad to avoid bad, slow code, it's
important to recognize that this is a trade-off---and that the
trade-off is often not worth it.

Another analogy I'd use is the teenager who feels the need to insist
upon their maturity, even though they are still very much
immature. Their actions are more a reaction to their perceived
mistakes than a nuanced decision.

And like how adulthood is learning to embrace some of the childish
aspects one rejected in adolesence, part of growing beyond this senior
developer trap is learning to embrace the beneficial aspects of junior
developers.

These could be accepting sloppier code when necessary. I don't mean
sloppy as in poorly formatted or named, but sloppy as in slower than
necessary, or perhaps not handling an edge case. A junior developer
doesn't handle an edge case because they didn't account for it. A
"senior" developer insists on handling all of the edge cases. A senior
developer figures out how to handle 80% of the cases in 20% of the work.
