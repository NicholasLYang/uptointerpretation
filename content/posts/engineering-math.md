*I felt like I wasn't living up to this blog's name, so here's a
manifesto about mathematics, something about which I know very little.*

We should engineer mathematics. We must treat mathematics as an
engineering discipline. The process of doing math should be the
process of writing code.

Mathematics is reaching fundamental limitations with its current
techniques and tools. Proofs are exceeding the capacity of a single
mind. Verifying arguments is becoming nigh impossible. The core value
of rigor is at stake here.

There is some irony here. Engineering itself was made rigorous through
mathematics. Now it must give the rigor back to mathematics.

I say "should" and "must", but really these judgements are
irrelevant. Mathematics **will** become a field of engineering. The
tools of engineering will not only return mathematics to rigor, but
they will offer their users immense freedom and fun in their
use. Future generations will adopt these tools with such fervor that
they will not comprehend practicing math without them.

Proof checking is the beginning of this reinvigoration. The art of
writing manual proofs will be seen by future generations like
dictation---quaint exercises from a byegone era.

Of course that is not a surprise. Mathematics has been stuck in
antiquated techniques for ages. Professors write on chalkboards while
doctoral programs continue to give oral exams. Not all of the old is
bad, but all should be reassessed perpetually.

The act of hand writing a proof, while it holds some charm and
sentimental value, will ultimately not be mourned when it passes
on. The hand written proof offers no feedback, no systematic format to
parse, no way of partitioning beyond chapters or lemmas.

Mathematicians scorn contributions from outside the world of academia,
treating the authors as crackpots, without reflecting that they have
no choice but to be crackpots, as there is no way to learn the art of
rigor without entering the temple of the math course and submitting
one's self to the lashings of grading. With proof checking, perhaps we
will see a swell of self-taught mathematicians, a democratization of
the field.

Even in the temple itself, we will see a shift. As of now,
undergraduates mathematics majors must learn the praxis of proofs
through repeated, thorough and unforgiving feedback from either a
professor or a teaching assistant. This requires endless hours of
grading flawed proofs, some flawed in obvious manners but perhaps some
in less clear ways. If a professor neglects this duty and lets
students through with flawed proofs, the damage is
severe. Undergraduates leave without understanding the core essence of
proof and simply the ritualistic aspects, the stitled vocabulary and
standard phrases.

Instead let us imagine a course where undergraduates are to use a
proof checker. If they attempt to construct an incorrect proof,
whether broadly or subtly incorrect, the checker will spit it back
with direct, specific feedback. Unlike the feedback of the hand
written proof, where the work and therefore the grade is a fait
accompli, the feedback of a checker offers opportunities to improve,
to tweak, to play. Play is the essence here. Mathematics offers
immense opportunities to play, but the mathematician must be both
player and referee. They must guard their thoughts without certainty
that they are correct. With a proof checker, they can play, knowing
the proof checker is keeping them in line.

However proof checking is only the beginning. Once math is represented
in code, it will be natural that mathematicians will begin adopting
the standard operating techniques of software engineers. Yes, rare is
the mathematician who adopts these techniques in the programs
currently written by mathematicians such as numerical simulations. But
a numerical simulation is not the fundamental core of the
mathematician's work. It is merely an offshoot, a representation of
the work.

Furthermore, the mathematician of now will be different than the
mathematician of future generations. As mathematics starts to be coded
instead of written, the field will attract coders. We often assume
that if one likes a field, one would like it in any time period, but
that is incorrect. The physics of the 20th century is unrecognizable
to the physics of the 18th century. The mathematics of the 22nd
century may be unrecognizable to us.

And finally it will be those who use the tool to its utmost, who learn
to scale programs using software development techniques, those will be
the ones who make progress and who people will follow.

We can imagine a mathematics research group of the
future. Mathematicians will work on programs, each member given a
specific portion to write, whether that is a theorem or a preliminary
lemma. While proof checkers should guarantee correctness, inevitably
some parts of the code will require tests to counterbalance holes in
proofs or potential bugs. Undergraduates or even non-students will be
able to contribute as long as their code compiles and passes
tests. When a theorem is completed, the group can publish its code on
a package repository, where other groups can download the code and use
it in their proofs. The group will consider the best interface and
abstractions to make their code usable for other groups.

This should sound revolutionary to a mathematician and utterly mundane
to a programmer. And indeed the mathematicians mentioned will not be
those who are currently working, or even those who are in school. They
will be a generation who is brought up in these techniques, who thinks
about math in code. It is now our job to bring about this generation.
