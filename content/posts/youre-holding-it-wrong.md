In many programming language communities, it's very common to see a
person come in with an issue, and instead of responding with a
solution, the community decides to criticize the issue
itself.

I call these "you're holding it wrong" responses. Specifically, these
responses are critical of the user's question, they don't actually
help the user in any way, and they show no empathy towards the user's
perspective. Examples of these include the documentation for
ReasonML's async story, where for the longest time they insisted that
users should just use callbacks. You can still see responses
[here](https://reasonml.chat/t/is-there-a-way-to-do-async-in-reasonml-without-promises/383/4)
that respond to questions about async with "callbacks work
great!"

That's not an answer. It's a dismissal of the entire premise of the
question. And it's a dismissal that doesn't sympathize with *why* a
user may want async await.

And the issue here is not that the feature is unavailable. Features
can be missing for a multitude of reasons, whether it's simply lack of
time, incompatibility with the language's philosophy, or trickiness of
implementation. The issue is that the responder is denying the user's
issues and claims them as invalid. It's just rude.

We can do better. We can explain that a feature is not available while
also recognizing that the user's needs are valid.
