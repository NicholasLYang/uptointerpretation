In many programming language communities, it's very common to see a
person come in with an issue, and instead of responding with a
solution, the community decides to criticize the issue
itself.

I call these "you're holding it wrong" responses. Specifically, these
responses are critical of the user's question, they don't actually
help the user in any way, and they show no empathy towards the user's
perspective. Examples of these include the documentation for
ReasonML's async story, where for the longest time they insisted that
users should just use callbacks. You can still see responses
[here](https://reasonml.chat/t/is-there-a-way-to-do-async-in-reasonml-without-promises/383/4)
that respond to questions about async with "callbacks work
great!"

That's not an answer. It's a dismissal of the entire premise of the
question. And it's a dismissal that doesn't sympathize with *why* a
user may want async await.

And the issue here is not that the feature is unavailable. Features
can be missing for a multitude of reasons, whether it's simply lack of
time, incompatibility with the language's philosophy, or trickiness of
implementation. The issue is that the responder is denying the user's
issues and claims them as invalid. It's just rude.

When someone is an insider of a language community, by that very
nature, they find the language comfortable to use. All the initial
pain points and quirks are no longer issues to them. That is not to
say that insiders have no issues with their language of
choice. Insiders can often give you a laundry list of problems or
areas of improvement. But that creates a tendency for insiders to then
the issues that they face. They'll respond to a complaint by declaring
that *this* issue is not a problem, it's really *that* issue that is
the major problem.

And very often, the insiders are correct. They know the language
better and they'd have a better idea of what features can actually be
changed versus what is inherent to the language. But we're not dealing
with just language design here. We're dealing with people. And people
like to be heard and understood. They like getting explanations
instead of dismissals. It wouldn't hurt for the insiders to respond
with sympathy. It wouldn't hurt to use these complaints as an
opportunity to teach the language in a more effective manner.

And sometimes the beginners are right. Because beginners are not just
beginners. Beginners are either future insiders or future exiles. What
determines whether they decide to stay is whether the benefits of
using the language outweigh the issues that they encounter as
beginners. If there are too many beginner issues, then people will not
stay. And because they leave, their opinions will not be heard in the
community. Therefore, beginners are a critical source of different
opinions from those of the general language community. Which in turn
should be very valuable to a programming language community. How a
language community treats its beginners is a very significant signal
on the community's homogeneity. And in turn, its homogeneity
determines the size of the community. If a community looks down upon
its beginners, it'll probably have a very rigid, very uniform
community. You see this in some languages where there is a
