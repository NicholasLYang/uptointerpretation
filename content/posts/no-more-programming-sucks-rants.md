There's this genre of programming talk that you see. It's a talk
focused around how everything in programming just sucks. They're not
always talks, sometimes they're a blog post or tweet thread. I care
less about those, simply because blog posts and tweets are free. With
talks, someone gave the platform and time to let this person
rant. Anyways, the talk often titled something like "The Mess of It
All" or "Stop Doing XYZ". The speaker goes on some rant about how
programming is a mess due to legacy, dependencies, performance, really
take your pick. They cherry pick some example of how programming is so
absurd and dumb, and tear it apart. Then, for some of these talks,
they propose their solution as a panacea to these problems.

I don't care for this genre. That isn't to say that the talks
themselves are devoid of good elements. They often have good insights
and are given by intelligent people. But the genre itself is overly
antagonistic, self-aggrandizing and disingenuous salesmanship.

That's a little too harsh, but it exemplifies my first issue with this
genre: lack of nuance. Because these talks are coming with a
perspective that "everything sucks", they often fail to acknowledge
that a lot of the issues come down to trade-offs. Yes, yes, our
computers are slower than they should be given the hardware
improvements, but we can also write portable programs a lot
easier. Sure, we have a lot of dependencies, but that saves developer
time and consolidates bugs. Even if the speaker disagrees with these
premises, they need to be acknowledged as justifications that the rest
of the programming world uses. It's the classic idea of Chesterton's
Fence; you cannot remove a fence unless you understand why it was
placed there. You cannot criticize a choice made, unless you
understand the trade-off.

And even if this is the extremely rare occasion where there is an
unquestionably right path that has not been taken, I still believe
that some level of empathy and grace is deserved. Programming is
hard. That is the truth of it. We are building systems that are
profoundly complicated, using tools that are extremely raw, in a field
that is still in its naissance. To be outraged that the field is a
mess, is to implicitly indicate that programming is something easy,
that these problems are not issues people can spend lifetimes
tackling, that we should "just" do better.

There are other issues with using the entirety of programming as a
target. For one, it becomes this generic gripe that most programmers
can align themselves with. Much as a politician can say something
blandly outraged like "our country is going down the drain! We need
change!" and get a vocal reception, even if Alice believes the
solution is estate tax reform while Bob believes it's fixing tort law,
the speakers of these talks can give some blandly outraged statements
about how programming is awful these days, and let each audience
member fill in the exact issue they have. Speakers may retort that if
the audience pays attention, they'd understand the precise issue
discussed. I'd counter that the majority of people will read the title
and maybe, just maybe, watch five minutes of the talk. And the first
five minutes of these talks seem to universally be some generic rant
about programming and the title of these talks seem to universally be
some generic "why programming sucks". I guarantee if the talk was
named "Why inefficient languages suck and how I plan to fix them",
there would be fewer people blindly agreeing with the talk, and a lot
more people engaging with the actual content.

This isn't to say that provocative talk titles and strong opinions are
necessarily bad. But they need to be well formed, specific
opinions. And much like an essay, a talk should start with this thesis
in an up front and clear manner.

I suppose what I'm really criticizing is a genre of talk that borders
on a manifesto. Programming is a subjective endeavor and to an extent
I do not begrudge someone for having a strong opinion. But the
difference between a strong opinion and a manifesto is that a
manifesto is inherently adversarial, it is inherently an aggressive,
general statement about programming, which, again, is subjective.

- No nuance. Fails to account for alternative incentives and difficulty
- Using people's general issues with programming to get people on board
  - Like how a politician can say a lot of generic stuff about how we've gone wrong and how the country needs change
  - Also at times a nostalgic ploy.
- It's just negative and not productive.
