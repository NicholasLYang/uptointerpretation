# Resources

Here's a list of resources for chili oil.

- [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfFNXX_BMHo): An interesting
  take by a Chinese chef. Uses the multiple infusion technique where a
  hot first infusion "is for spice", and then subsequent infusions are
  for flavor. Uses a combination of chili flakes, chili powder, and
  hand ground chilies. The video does claim that adding spices lessens
  the chili flavor.

- [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zo0aGgCuvH4): Probably one of
  the best Chinese videos on chili oil by Chef Wang Gang. Similar
  technique to above with an interesting wrinkle of adding baijiu,
  supposedly to avoid burning the chilies. I wonder if it adds to
  flavor extraction too. Also lots of interesting spices and herbs
  added.

- [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpgawC2FKp4): Another Wang Gang
  video. I don't like douchi in chili oil, but this one is interesting
  for the step where the spices are soaked in baijiu to extract
  flavor.

- [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GezQyVRQRzU): Still my go-to
  recipe for a chili crisp. Sohla does a great job of adding a balance
  of flavors with additions like mushroom powder, MSG, sugar, and a
  whole bunch of spices. The single hot flash does the trick and the
  sugar offsets any potential bitterness. Fantastic recipe.

- [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZJtOATAZl4): This is a really
  interesting idea of using clarified butter to make an oil with a
  fairly standard slow infusion process, then blending it with toasted
  milk powder to make essentially brown butter. Kathy seems to blend
  all of the aromatics too (I think?) which is interesting. She then
  whips it up into a compound butter, kinda close to beef fat hot pot
  base. I'd love to try this although the clarified butter does make a
  more expensive oil.
