I started watching Apple's new Foundation series. It's...provided me
with some thoughts.

- The use of diverse casting is well done and overall very good for
  the show. Gaal Dornick being a woman of color adds a nice nuance to
  the character.

- Similarly giving Gaal an Australian accent is a great way to
  emphasize her provincialness.

- However, I don't see why she needed to also become this young
  ingenue who somehow becomes brilliant at math. Gaal in the books is
  young, but has a PhD and is academically trained. It would have been
  nice to have a woman of color in such a role and is a little odd to
  deprive the character of these qualifications in the process of
  making her female and Black.

- There's a whole bunch of additions that heighten the drama but don't
  mesh very well with the overarching themes.

  - For instance, the book makes a point that Hari Seldon, while
    important, is not seen as a super direct threat. He's not about to
    overthrow the government and they know that.

  - Indeed the emperors are never seen in the book because they don't
    have the real power. At that point in the Empire it's far beyond a
    single person.

  - The book ascribes way too much agency to various single
    entities. The terrorist attack for instance.

- Why have these trials broadcast? What does that get you? The
  committee in the book explicitly does not do that because it'd just
  give Hari Seldon more publicity.

- There could be a really interesting political commentary on global
  warming vis a vis the fall of the empire.

- Jared Harris is not my topic choice for Hari. He's a little younger
  than I expected. Wonderful actor whom I loved in Fringe and Mad Men
  but not the wise, elder statesmen I got from the books.

- It'd have been interesting to have the terrorists be Trantorians but
  then scapegoat the outer kingdoms. I suppose that's still possible.

- Of course the casting is more diverse but not Asian. C'mon
  guys. Diversity isn't just Black people.

- Credits are very Westworld-y

- There's starting to be a "tradition of quality" in TV. The show is
  very well made, clearly high budget, but utterly formulaic in its
  execution and direction.

- I want to know if the writers have met a mathematician and if so
  what kind of weird ass mathematician that was.

- If I could ban violins playing a high note in soundtracks I
  would. So lazy. Fucking hell it's so manipulative and definitely
  part of the tradition of quality.

- It feels like Apple wanted a Game of Thrones type show and made
  Foundation into one. Again, mimicry of quality instead of risky
  innovation.

- I wish there was a sci-fi series that acknowledged the existence of
  pop culture. It's so offputting how nobody has actual lives in these
  shows. It's a simulacrum of a life.

- It's a law that all sci-fi/fantasy shows must have characters say
  "gods" instead of "God".

- I expected Pirenne to be pronounced in a French manner. He has a
  very Boris Johnson haircut.

- The point about representation could have been made better

- Wow that speech scene was actually genuine? I thought it was going to backfire.
