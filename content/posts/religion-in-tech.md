The tech community has some fascinating examples of religious
behavior. I'm not talking about developers who are Christian, Muslim,
or so on. But moreso tendencies and behavior that, when abstracted and
looked at from a more ethnographic perspective, tend to match similar
behaviors in religious communities.

As a preface, I want to emphasize that religious does not imply
bad. One could argue that religious tendencies are a fundamental
emergent behavior of human psychology. As much as us in tech industry
like to consider ourselves rational, objective beings, we are no
different than any other group of humans.

With that said, in some places, there is further criticism of these
religious tendencies. Again, these are criticisms of the tendencies
themselves and how they hurt people, not the religious aspect
itself. Furthermore, these criticisms are not meant as denegration,
but instead as a form of analysis and critique. Without healthy,
constructive, thoughtful critique, both of oneself and of others,
there is no self-awareness or self-improvement.

# Tools For Thought

If you've waded into the waters of Hacker News or similar communities,
you've surely encountered the tools for thought movement. I'm using
"tools for thought" to encompass a few intertwined communities such as
programming languages, developer tooling, cybernetics fans, note
taking obsessives, productivity nerds, rationalists (more on them
later), and so on.

The tools for thought community is based around this idea that with
the right tools, usually some sort of note taking, personal assistant,
productivity app, programmers will unlock a significant (often order
of magnitude) increase in productivity, awareness, memory,
etc. Essentially, these tools will produce a path towards a sort of
cybernetic enlightenment.

Within this community, there are many pieces of scripture, written by
various prophets such as Warren Weaver, Vannevar Bush, Alan Kay, Andy
Matuschak, etc. Often the scripture is a description of a "lost
science" of sorts, a forgotten innovation (Vannevar Bush's Memex,
Alan Kay's Smalltalk) that was either too early for its time or lost
despite being the "morally correct[^1]" option. The goal for many acolytes
is to revive these forgotten innovations to bring about enlightenment.

    Better](https://dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html).


It's worth noting that most of these prophets are white men who
operated in prestigious, intertwined circles. And indeed, the message
often preached is that of a Horatio Alger, self-improvement, salvation
through capitalism perspective. If one works hard enough and uses the
right tools, one will succeed. It is not surprising that the people
who preach this message are the economic, social, and cultural elites.

# Calvinism and Protestant Work Ethic

Continuing on this thought, I've noticed a rather interesting flavor
of the classic Calvinist philosophy that shows up in tech. Calvinist
doctrine states that all people who go to heaven were predestined to
do so from their birth. Thus, the people who were predestined to go to
heaven must have been blessed by God, and therefore, would face
prosperity in their life. In short, if one is rich, they must be
predestined to go to heaven.

In tech, the predestination is not so much about being blessed, as
much as it is about being smart. Intellect is highly prized within
tech. Cults of personality are created around the supposedly smartest
of them all. Of course, intellect in this case means technical ability
first and foremost. Tech CEOs, venture capital investors, designers
all have to demonstrate their programming chops, even if it is not
relevant for their work.

This is especially prevalent in venture capital. Venture firms
emphasize that they care about the founders above all else. The
founders must be smart, techy coders. They must fit the pattern-match
(note the performative technical language) of prior icons such as the
young, skinny, ingenue (Vitalik Buterin, Patrick Collison, Bill Gates)
or the charismatic visionary businessman (Steve Jobs, Elizabeth
Holmes, Adam Neumann). People ridiculed the rather obvious posturing
of Elizabeth Holmes, with the black turtleneck, deeped voice, and
emphasis on a "engineering background" (a whole two years of college),
but it worked! People bought it. They bought it because of their
assumption that people who fit these superficial patterns must be
predestined for success.

Some may note that this concept of predestination conflicts with the
self-improvement, Horatio Alger philosophy of tools for thought. I'd
disagree, as that combination is a fundamental part of American
capitalism in the form of the Protestant work ethic. One is wealthy
and therefore blessed, because the blessed are the hard workers.

# Effective Altruism and Rationalism

I struggled for a while to categorize the Effective Altruism (EA)
movement. I found their assumption of superiority rather arrogant,
even though their actions did help people. After some time, I
realized: The EA movement is just a religion that happens to have an
emphasis on charity! From that perspective, I'm not against the
doctrine of Effective Altruism as much as the institution of EA. Do I
agree with their doctrine?  No. But I also do not agree with
Christianity and yet I am fine with a church running a soup kitchen. I
am *not* fine with the institution of the church being used to
perpetuate sexual and mental abuse, homophobia and racism.

As with any organized religion, there are abuses of power and abuses
of doctrine. In EA's case the abuses of power came in the standard
form of sexual abuse and financial fraud. The abuses of doctrine are
the focus on AI. Thought experiments on an omniscent AI destroying
humanity is no different than thought experiments around Judgement Day
or Pascal's Wager. Logic being applied to faith is not new.

And yes, there is faith within Effective Altruism. One donates to an
EA-affiliated organization and trusts that the brilliant minds in EA
leadership will know how to most effectively spend the
money. Nevermind that one could construct a moral argument for almost
any charitable endeavor being the optimal use of money.

The danger comes, as is often the case in tech, from the emphasis on
innovation. Because EA is of tech, it is an innovation beyond that of
a traditional religious charity. Much as WeWork must be an innovation
beyond that of a traditional real estate company, or cryptocurrencies
must be an innovation beyond traditional financial securities. This
innovation aims to insulate EA from the traditional criticism of
religious entities, and convinces people who would otherwise be
appalled to be labeled religious that EA is not the same.
