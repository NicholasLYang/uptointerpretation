New York is one of the greatest cities to eat in. This should come as
no surprise. It has a stunning diversity in cuisine. As such, I read a
lot of posts by people who have come to New York to eat. Here's some
notes I've distilled from reading and responding to them.

# Diversity

A lot of these plans consist of going to a series of fancy
restaurants, usually in Manhattan or perhaps Williamsburg. For me,
this seems rather monotonous on a few levels. For one, fancy
restaurants often have very similar formats, styles and even
menus. They can be quite special as singular events, but in series
they can blend together. Unless they were quite wealthy, most locals
would not be eating at I Sodi then Balthazar then Le Bernadin. Plus
fancy restaurants tend to use a lot of luxurious, fatty ingredients,
so by the third place you might be at your limit.

Second, you want to get a diversity of location. I understand that's
hard when visiting, because an hour long train ride takes up valuable
time, but truly, New York is better if you're not stuck in the dense
touristy part all day. New York has fantastic neighborhoods with a
huge diversity of food. You can go to Sunset Park and get Mexican and
Sichuan food together. Or Jackson Heights for Bengali, Ecuadorian, and
Mexican. Or Flushing for Korean and Chinese. They're truly melting
pots in the best sense

These neighborhoods are also much more conducive to grazing,
i.e. going from store to store, trying a bit of food at each
place. You can go to get a plate of chili oil wontons, then some baos,
or maybe a bowl of Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and top it off with
some kimbap. Over the course of a few hours you could graze through
several restaurants and still have room for dinner.

Oh and this will be significantly cheaper than staying in
Manhattan. This is the type of food the locals making 20 an hour are
eating.

# Uniqueness

That said, a splurge meal is always fun. If you wish to do one, I'd
recommend picking a place that is truly unique to New York. Unless you
really really love pasta, it may not be that worth going to a pasta
place. You probably have some sort of good Italian restaurant at
home. Yes, yes, I Sodi, Rezdora, and others are fantastic.
