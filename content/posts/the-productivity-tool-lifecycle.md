I did a little work on productivity tools a while ago. During that
process, I came up with a hypothesis about how people use productivity
tools, and why many tools seemingly succeed even though they're not
that effective.

The lifecycle goes as following:

1. You feel unproductive. Whether because of imposter syndrome,
   unrealistic expectations around working, or genuine impairments,
   you feel that you are not able to get work done at a sufficient
   pace.

2. You reach for a productivity tool. It has a fancy marketing page
   and makes a convincing argument for why you will be so productive
   and effective with its knowledge graph/key commands/cybernetic
   memex. Lots of your friends have posted about the insane
   productivity gains they've gotten from using it.

3. Charmed by the tool, you get a nice boost of placebo effect, and
   pump out some work. Hey, this thing seems to work!

4. You tweet/xeet/blog about it to everyone, proudly showing off how
   you managed to become a true 10x developer with this one simple
   trick.

5. The placebo effect wears off. You go back to your normal work
   rate. But the tool must work! All of your friends seem to be using
   it properly. You don't say anything out of embarassement.

6. You feel unproductive.

This isn't to say that all productivity tools are bad or that

benefits are vastly overstated. Productivity comes from motivation,
from mental and physical wellness, from your surrounding
environment. A tool can only do so much to affect these factors.

Indeed one issue I have with productivity tools is the rather generic
category of productivity. In my view there's a lot of tools that
improve my productivity significantly, but are
