You're a high school student who is interested in computer
science. Maybe you've done some programming already. Maybe you've
taken a couple classes at your high school. Maybe you're a total
beginner[^1]. How do you judge CS programs?

[^1]: If you're a CS prodigy with IOI medals and high school tech
    internships, the answer to this post is easy: go to Waterloo, MIT, CMU, or
    Stanford.

## Why Are You Qualified?

In short, I'm not. This is equally a rumination on CS program quality
as much as a prescriptive guide.

The long answer is that I've spent a lot of time[^2] thinking about
undergraduate CS program quality because I recently graduated from a
program that appears prestigious on paper but was, in my opinion,
worse than schools with a tenth of the reputation. You can read my
thoughts
[here](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/11/12/goto-nyu-cs-considered-harmful.html)
and
[here](https://blog.torchnyu.com/2020/12/10/intellectual-ambition.html). I've
spent time going to other school's hackathons, talking to students at
other schools, reading through the degree requirements of various CS
program and generally doing my homework.

[^2]: Well, okay, 5 years

Some may believe that a professor is better suited to judge programs,
since they've likely had experience with multiple through their
undergrad, grad, post-doc and professor tenures. I'd counter that
professors are judging from a rather unique perspective, namely that
of a tenured professor. I'll explore that point in depth in a bit. I'd
also note that being a teacher in an undergraduate CS program is
extremely different than being a student in one. Professors usually
only experience one small part of an undergraduate CS program and
therefore can't really judge it as a gestalt. That said, I'd be very
interested to hear a professor's take on undergraduate CS programs.

If you'd like to give a rebuttal, I'd love to hear it! Heck, I'll
publish it here as long as you're not unneccessarily mean.

## How Not To Do It

Here's how to **not** do it. Do not go off of ranking. Not US News &
World, not even the wonderful
[CSRankings.org](http://csrankings.org/). Ranking does not relate to
undergraduate experience in any realistic fashion. Generally ranking
measures the status of the university as a research institution. Even
then, in the case of US News & World, these rankings are not well
loved among professors. I'd ignore them almost completely.

Do not go off of prestige signifiers such as Ivy League or admission
rate. These can indicate a general amount of funding or student
quality, but beyond that there is nothing about Ivy League schools
that makes them inherently good at computer science.

Do not look up very famous professors and think "oh I'm gonna work
with them". As great of a fantasy as it is, working with Yann LeCun at
NYU is pretty unlikely.r I get that a common admissions strategy is
"demonstrating interest", but Googling professors is not that much
demonstration.

## What Do You Want?

For a lot of students, this answer is approximately the same. They
want a CS program that gives them a good, thorough education that
provides them the skills they need to get a job as a programmer. With
this comes other requirements such as a good community of students who
are smart and helpful; professors who can teach well; decent resources
for job searching and extracurriculars. I'm generally going to assume
you're in this category for the rest of the post.

There's a few other categories. There's the future academic. They want
to go into academia and become a professor. If you have somehow
decided on this as a career in high school, then I am extremely
impressed. In which case, I'd recommend looking at
[CSRankings.org](http://csrankings.org/) and reading the [advice for
applying to graduate school
page](http://csrankings.org/advice.html). You're not going to be
applying to graduate school just yet, but this advice will influence
where you'd want to go for undergrad. If you've managed to even figure
out a domain of research (wow!), then of course you can filter by that
domain in CSRankings.org.

I will caution that you may believe in your heart of hearts that this
is your preordained path, but stuff changes and what may have seemed
so certain in high school, may not be so in college. It's still good
to follow the rest of the advice, just in case you end up not going
down the academic path.

The other category is the entrepreneur. I'm not 100% sure what is the
best combo for entrepreneurs. I will say that a good community seems
essential, as finding good co-founders seems to be an essential part
of being an entrepreneur. Otherwise the advice should be similar;
you'll need to be a decent programmer either way.

## Signs Of A Good Program

Now I'm gonna list various signs that I've noticed tend to imply a
good CS program. These signs are not always a direct correlation,
i.e. absence of one of these does not imply a bad program. They're
also very subjective to my interests and my beliefs in what makes a CS
program good.

Take a look at their intro to programming. Is it a perfunctory
Java/Python tutorial that you can skip with AP credit? Or is it
something deeper that everybody is required to take? Does the course
encourage you to think about program design and computation at a deep
level? Does it use a book like [How To Design
Programs](https://htdp.org/) or [Structure and Interpretation of
Computer
Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html). Does
it use an off-kilter language like Haskell or Lisp? This is a sign
that someone put a little thought into the CS program.

What do their clubs and extracurriculars look like? Do they have up to
date websites? Are there projects listed on a GitHub organization? Are
these projects active? How many events do they run?

Is there a piece of student written software in common use at the
school? Something like [YACS](https://yacs.cs.rpi.edu/) goes a long
way in demonstrating a healthy community.

Is their curriculum thorough? Do they teach classes on systems level
programming, operating systems, compilers, databases, theoretical
computer science, programming languages, distributed systems,
functional programming, cybersecurity, and machine learning? One fact
that shocks most programmers is that my school does not have an
undergraduate compilers course. Do they require these courses?

Find a course website (at least a few professors have public
ones). Compare it to another school's course site. Are similar topics
covered? Does one school cover noticably less ground? Are the
assignments based around **programming**? If not programming, are they
at least based around solving difficult problems?

## Programming, Yes Programming

You've probably noticed that I've emphasized programming. Whenever I
do this, I inevitably get the same tired response of "Buuuuut CS iS
NoT ProGraMmIng". And yes, reducing down computer science to the act
of programming is like reducing down literature to the act of writing
news articles. But if hundreds of thousands of companies were
clamoring for journalists and these jobs paid six figures easily and
99% of people who enter a literature program intended on becoming
journalists, you'd be forgiven for confusing the two as an
undergraduate.

And indeed, yes, I will say that effectively, for 99% of
undergraduates, computer science is programming. If you respond to the
contrary, you are being a pedantic jerk. That isn't to say that the
non-programming aspects of computer science are bad. A CS program can
and should have non-programming oriented classes such as Discrete
Math, Algorithms, Theory of Computation, etc. It's just that they're
less important to your average undergrad.

## Hackathons

For a while, I used hackathons as a sign. If your school runs a good
hackathon, it probably means it's a good CS program. Now, hackathons
are a little pass√©, what with the pandemic and just general
decline. But back in the day, if a school had a hackathon that
attracted a lot of students, had good sponsors and good prizes, and
was decently well run, that would be a good sign.

If a lot of students show up to hackathons, that's also a good sign. I
clued into University of Waterloo being quite good when I noticed all
the damn Waterloo students winning all the damn hackathons.

Of course now that's all a little dated. I'd be curious to know if
there's a similar event out there.

## Signs Of A Bad Program

In some cases, the inverse of the good sign is a negative
indicator. Intro class is perfunctory Java/Python tutorial; limited
course selection; insipid clubs/extracurriculars. However, I wouldn't
rule out a school if you can't find good student run projects or if a
course is slightly less thorough.

Ironically, a school's general prestige can be a bad sign. For
instance, my school is a fairly prestigious school. It's not an Ivy
but it's good enough that it took a little effort to get
admitted. However, it is not a school that is well known for computer
science. Therefore, the students who get into my school are strong in
terms of academics, but maybe not so strong in terms of computer
science. This leads to students who are really focused on getting good
grades, but maybe not on programming or computer science as a whole.

Etch this into your brain: **grades do not make me a good programmer**.

## Top Students

One area that I'd try to examine are the top students within the
program. This is hard. I don't exactly know how you find the top
students. Often times they're not easily visible. They're not always
on social media. They don't always show up to class. They may not go
to the top companies.

But if you can find people who are doing really cool stuff---stuff
like writing a compiler, building sophisticated websites from scratch,
developing their own operating system, etc---if you can find dozens of
people doing this, then you are in a good place. If there's a
sprinkling of these people, be cautious. If there's next to nobody,
stay away completely.

These people are your potential role models, peers, even
rivals. Without them, you are not going to learn half as much.

Of course some may see the professors as potential role models. They
can be! But professors are not always great role models. For one, they
chose a path that most students will not. If you wish to go into
academia, by all means, seek out graduate students and professors as
role models. Second, professors were and are profoundly good
students. Philip Guo has this excellent memoir of his time as a
graduate student[^3]. He has a great observation that his doctoral
advisor must had been one of the top graduate students in order to
become a tenure track professor at Stanford. Therefore it was rather
hard for his advisor to understand Philip's struggles, because the
advisor had never struggled to that degree.

[^3]: I believe he removed it from his website, which is a shame.

I have a longer piece on this, but becoming a professor is something
that requires an extreme amount of talent but also devotion and
time. You need to know pretty early on that you want to become a
professor, otherwise you'll have to spend a lot of time hustling back
into the academia timeline. Talking to tenure track professors is a
great way to experience survivorship bias.

As I mentioned before, top students are not necessarily the people who
go to top companies. Getting into a top company does not actually
require prodigious programming ability. You need a decent resume, the
ability to solve the interview questions, and a whole lot of
luck. Second, a lot of top students aren't always so interested in top
companies or willing to play the game. Filling out applications is
boring and they'd much rather be programming.
