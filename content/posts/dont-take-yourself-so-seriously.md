I recently wrote a post about how [you should embrace being an
amateur](https://uptointerpretation.com/posts/don-t-underestimate-the-amateurs/). There's
one addendum I'd like to make. Often times this predilection that
companies have for "professionalism", i.e. rigid, slow processes,
comes from a sense of importance. Every startup has to be a little
self-important. That's what gets employees and customers to buy into
what's honestly a pretty risky proposition.

But this self-importance can backfire. If you believe that the mission
of the company is so grand and important, it's easy to be afraid of
making mistakes. After all, if this mission is so important, we can't
screw up. People are counting on us, so we need to avoid mistakes at
all costs. More subtly, a startup's mission is often that there is
this big, huge problem, and the company is the anointed, predestined
savior for this problem. If those are the expectations, people start
to get scared about making mistakes. After all, they're supposed to be
the chosen ones, and the chosen ones can't screw up!

This is a classic issue of setting expectations. The expectations that
are required to pitch a startup, to get funding, etc. are not the
expectations that are healthy in your day to day work. At the end of
the day, the people in the company are still fallible human
beings. Everybody will make mistakes. Especially at a startup where
you won't have existing institutional knowledge or processes.

Also, if everybody's so afraid of making mistakes, they may refuse to
acknowledge when something was indeed a mistake. I've been in
situations where we all know that a decision was a mistake, but nobody
was willing to talk about it.

In short: If you're afraid of making mistakes, don't work at a
startup.
