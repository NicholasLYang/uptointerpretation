Or, your company doesn't pay you to write dependencies.

I've worked with some brilliant programmers. They've produced code
that has truly been mindblowing. Some of them have produced this code
on the way to successfully shipping products that have gained massive
amounts of users. And others have produced code that...didn't do
that. And if I'm being honest with myself, what determined this
outcome wasn't really the code. Sure, if the code was really bad,
resulting in a product that's extremely slow and buggy, that would
probably affect the outcome. But first, that's a bit of a
strawman. It's not like developers just set out to either write good
code or bad code. Usually bad code comes from tradeoffs made in terms
of deadlines, standardization, architectural decisions, etc. Code that
may be worse in one dimension might be better in another. I'll take
the buggy codebase that shipped over the perfect codebase that didn't.

In my experience, what generally determines a product's success is
the quality of the product work.
